Can you find a way to make Brussels sprouts that doesn't taste like punishment?\n\n### Listen to Your Body (It's Smarter Than You Think)\n\nYour body has an incredible ability to tell you what it needs, but processed foods can jam the signal. When you start eating more whole foods, you might notice:\n\n- Cravings for fresh fruit instead of candy\n- Actually feeling satisfied after meals\n- Energy that doesn't require caffeine to maintain\n- Better sleep and mood\n\n## The Bottom Line (Served on a Whole Grain Plate)\n\nYou don't need to eat like a Instagram influencer or spend your entire paycheck at Whole Foods. You just need to make choices that honor the fact that your body is the only one you get, and it deserves fuel that helps it function optimally.\n\nStart small, be patient with yourself, and remember that every whole food choice is a vote for how you want to feel. Your future self ‚Äì the one with stable energy, clear skin, and a digestive system that doesn't hate you ‚Äì is cheering you on.\n\nNow go forth and eat something that grew in dirt or had a mother. Your body will thank you, your energy will soar, and you might just discover that healthy food can be absolutely delicious.\n\n**Final Challenge:** This week, try adding one new whole food to each meal. Not replacing anything, just adding. See how you feel. We're betting you'll feel pretty amazing.\n\n::author-about\n---\n:name: author\n:src: author_avatar\n---\n#body\nI build and ship stuff that comes into my mind while I am taking a shit.

The power of consistency is literally exponential! üìà\ntitle: Math That Will Blow Your Mind\ntype: success\n---\n::\n\n### Applying the 2% Rule\n\n- **Workout 2% longer** each week (10 minutes becomes 10.2 minutes)\n- **Add 2% more vegetables** to your meals\n- **Sleep 2% better** by improving your bedtime routine slightly\n- **Read 2% more** each day (5 minutes becomes 5.1 minutes)\n\nIt sounds ridiculous because it IS ridiculous ‚Äì ridiculously effective.\n\n## Environmental Design: Making Consistency Inevitable\n\nYour environment is either working for you or against you. There's no neutral. If you want to be consistent, you need to design your surroundings to make the right choice the easy choice.\n\n### Make Good Habits Obvious\n\n- **Visual cues everywhere:** Put your workout clothes where you'll see them\n- **Reduce friction:** Keep healthy snacks at eye level, hide the junk food\n- **Stack habits:** Attach new habits to existing ones (after I pour my morning coffee, I take my vitamins)\n\n### Make Bad Habits Invisible\n\n- **Increase friction:** Put your phone in another room when you want to focus\n- **Remove temptations:** Don't buy food you don't want to eat\n- **Change your route:** If you always stop for donuts on Main Street, take Oak Street instead\n\n::u-card\n---\nclass: mt-4\nvariant: subtle\n---\nMake good habits 20 seconds easier to start and bad habits 20 seconds harder. Want to exercise? Sleep in your workout clothes. Want to eat less junk food? Put it in the basement freezer instead of the kitchen counter. Small friction changes, big behavioral results.\n\n#header\nThe 20-Second Rule\n::\n\n## The Power of Systems Over Goals\n\nGoals are great for setting direction, but systems are what get you there. Goals are the destination; systems are the vehicle.\n\n**Goal thinking:** \"I want to lose 20 pounds\"\n**Systems thinking:** \"I want to become someone who moves their body daily and nourishes it well\"\n\nThe goal gives you a target, but the system gives you a process. And here's the kicker ‚Äì if you fall in love with the process, the results become inevitable.\n\n### Building Anti-Fragile Systems\n\n- **Plan for imperfection:** What's your minimum viable version when life gets crazy?\n- **Create comeback protocols:** How will you get back on track after you inevitably slip?\n- **Build in flexibility:** Can your habit adapt to different circumstances?\n- **Focus on identity:** Who do you need to become to achieve what you want?\n\n## Overcoming the Motivation Myth\n\nMotivation is like a fair-weather friend ‚Äì great when things are going well, but nowhere to be found when you actually need it. Successful people aren't more motivated; they've just built systems that don't depend on motivation.\n\n::alert\n---\ndescription: You will not feel like doing it most days. That's not a bug in your\n  system ‚Äì that's a feature of being human. The goal is to do it anyway,\n  especially when you don't feel like it. üöÄ\ntitle: Reality Check\ntype: warning\n---\n::\n\n### Strategies for Motivationless Days\n\n1. **Make it smaller:** Can't do 30 minutes? Do 5. Can't do 5? Do 1.\n2. **Change the definition:** \"Working out\" can mean dancing to one song in your living room\n3. **Focus on showing up:** Consistency is about presence, not performance\n4. **Celebrate micro-wins:** You showed up when you didn't want to ‚Äì that's heroic\n\n## The Consistency Toolkit: Practical Strategies That Actually Work\n\n### Track, But Make It Simple\n\n- **Habit tracker apps** that send gentle reminders\n- **Wall calendar** with big X's for completed days (don't break the chain!)\n- **Simple journal** noting how you feel before and after\n- **Photo logs** for visual progress tracking\n\n### Accountability Without Shame\n\n- **Find a habit buddy** who shares your commitment to growth\n- **Join communities** of people working on similar goals\n- **Share your progress** without perfectionism pressure\n- **Hire a coach or trainer** if the investment motivates you\n\n### Recovery Protocols for When Life Happens\n\nLife will happen. You'll get sick, go on vacation, have work deadlines, or just have a terrible week. That's not failure ‚Äì that's being human.\n\n**The comeback formula:** Miss one day? Get back immediately. Miss two days? Never miss three. It's not about perfect streaks; it's about perfect recoveries.\n\n## The Identity Shift: Becoming vs. Doing\n\nThe most powerful part of consistency isn't what you accomplish ‚Äì it's who you become. Every time you keep a promise to yourself, you're building evidence that you're someone who follows through.\n\n**Instead of:** \"I'm trying to eat healthy\"\n**Try:** \"I'm someone who nourishes my body well\"\n\n**Instead of:** \"I should work out more\"\n**Try:** \"I'm someone who prioritizes movement\"\n\nThis isn't just positive thinking fluff ‚Äì it's about aligning your actions with your identity. When your behavior matches your identity, consistency becomes automatic.\n\n## The Bottom Line: Small Hinges Swing Big Doors\n\nConsistency isn't about perfection ‚Äì it's about persistence. It's not about massive changes ‚Äì it's about marginal gains. It's not about being superhuman ‚Äì it's about being systematically human.\n\nThe people you admire who seem to have their lives together aren't genetically superior. They've just figured out how to make tiny improvements consistently over time. They've learned that boring is beautiful when it comes to building the life you want.\n\nStart today. Start small. Start where you are with what you have. Your future self ‚Äì the one who built incredible results through the simple act of showing up daily ‚Äì is already cheering you on.\n\n::alert\n---\ndescription: Pick ONE habit. Make it stupidly small. Do it for 7 days. Then come\n  back and tell us how it felt to keep a promise to yourself for a whole week.\n  We're betting it feels pretty amazing! üí™\ntitle: Your Mission\ntype: success\n---\n::\n\n::author-about\n---\n:name: author\n:src: author_avatar\n---\n#body\nI build and ship stuff that comes into my mind while I am taking a shit.
